TorTools v. 0.2.1.win32.prelaunch

This product is incomplete, untested and still very much in development.
TorTools.exe is published under the GNU GPL 3.0
Other libraries are published under different licenses.

As of this version, here is a rough run down of things that work
Directory Monitoring - Whichever dir is being watched will report changes in the console.
Save settings to registry
Reload settings on restart
Some, but not all, button commands
The overlay loads, can be moved, and hidden again.

Things that do not work at all:
Actual parsing of combat data.
Checking for updates, or anything regarding network conenctions
The entire Account tab by the previous declaration
The entire Results tab as well

What feedback I'm looking for:
Layout, design, etc. Also any crashes you get while using current functionality.
If possible, copy and send debug console after crash.
